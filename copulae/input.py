    Creates the input tensors needed to train neural
    copulas. If `bootstrap=True` then random inputs are
    generated by empirically sampling from the CDF of the
    data. If `bootstrap=False`, then a single batch is
    returned.

    See the notes below for differences when
    bootstrapping and when not bootstrapping

    **Bootstrapping (bootstrap=True)**

    The returned tensors will be organized in batches
    (a total of `n_batches`), each batch containing
    `batch_size` elements.

    Batches are created using a bootstrap sampling
    procedure which generates samples based on the
    empirical cumulative distribution function (ecdf).

    The steps to produce the batches are as follows:
    1. For each dimension in the dataset `D`:
        a. Generate `batch_size` random numbers uniformly
           in [0, 1].
        b. For each of the numbers above, sample
           `batch_size` data points for that by
           sampling from the ecdf of the dimension.
        c. Store the uniform value from (a) in U; the
           data points in X; the ecdf of X in M
           (for marginal);
    2. and, finally store the joint ecdf for every
       dimension in Y.

    Steps (1) and (2) generate a single batch.

    **No Bootstrap (bootstrap=False)**

    A single batch is returned with the size of the
    dataset. The arguments returned are the same as when
    bootstrapping.

    The arguments `min_val`, `max_val`, `n_batches` and
    `batch_size` are ignored when not bootstrapping.

    Arguments
    ---------
    key: jax.random.PRNGKey
        The key used for random number generation, must be
        discarded afterwards.
    D: Tensor
        Our dataset of (`n_dimensions`, `n_samples`)
    min_val: int (defaults to 0)
    max_val: int (defaults to 1)
        Min and max values are used to generate the uniform
        random values used as input to the copula. By
        definition a copula receives only values in [0, 1]
        as input. However, we may sample values out of this
        range in order to train corner cases.
    n_batches: int
        Number of batches to generate
    batch_size: int
        The size of each batch

    Returns
    -------
    Six tensors:

    U_bs: Tensor (n_batches, n_dimensions, batch_size)
        The tensor that serves as input to train neural
        copulas.
    M_bs: Tensor (n_batches, n_dimensions, batch_size)
        Marginal cumulative distribution functions (ecdf)
        for each dimension.
    X_bs: Tensor (n_batches, n_dimensions, batch_size)
        Data points associated with each marginal above.
    Y_bs: Tensor (n_batches, n_dimensions, batch_size)
        The output of the neural copula. A joint cumulative
        distribution estimate of the values in `X_bs`.
