'''
Copulae
-------

A python module for training non-parametric neural copulas.


Modules You'll Likelly Use
--------------------------

The `twod`, `nd` and `training` modules are probably the
ones you'll need.

twod: defines copula networks for two dimensional datasets

nd: defines copula networks for n-dimesional datasets.
    Builds on the two dimensional (twod) module.

training: functions for training copula networks.

Other Modules
-------------

mlp: Neural network definitions. Done from scratch as to 
     have more control on how the network behaves.

kde: kernel density estimators used as auxiliary functions
     in network training.

typing: Some type aliases for type annotations.

utils: common utilities that don't really fit any other
       module.
