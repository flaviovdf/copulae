Copulae
-------

A python module for training non-parametric neural copulas.


Modules You'll Likelly Use
--------------------------

The `training`, `twod`, `nd` and `input` modules are
probably the ones you'll need.

training: Neural network definitions. Done from scratch as
          to  have more control on how the network behaves.

c: defines copula networks for two dimensional datasets

np_input: functions for generating copula networks inputs.

Other Modules
-------------

kde: kernel density estimators used as auxiliary functions
     in network training.

typing: Some type aliases for type annotations.

utils: common utilities that don't really fit any other
       module.
